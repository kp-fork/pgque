# PgQue Partition Keys — Spec

- **Version:** v0.7 (draft)
- **Status:** review rounds 1–3 applied. **Phase 1 (`skip`-default partition
  consumption) is converged / implementation-ready.** Phase 2 (`pause` strict
  ordering) is specified but has open design items (§11) and is a deliberate
  follow-up. See §16 changelog and `decisions.md`.
- **Slug:** partition-keys
- **Scope:** consumer-side ordered, parallel consumption by partition key.
  Producer-side idempotency/dedup is a separate spec (deferred — §12).

---

## 1. Goal

Within one queue, events sharing a partition key are consumed **in order by a
single worker at a time**; events with different keys are consumed **in
parallel** — the log-native ("Kafka partition") model: order *within* a key,
parallelism *across* keys.

## 2. The guarantee (precise, testable)

- **G1 — per-key affinity + FIFO.** For a queue whose events carry a partition
  key and a fixed slot count `N`, every event of key `K` maps to one slot
  `slot(K) = (hashtextextended(K, 0) % N + N) % N` (the `+N` normalizes the sign;
  `hashtextextended` returns `bigint`). Within that slot, non-retried events of
  `K` are delivered in non-decreasing `ev_id` order, to **no other slot**.
  Intra-batch order is the engine's `order by 1` (`pgque.sql:440`), preserved
  through `get_batch_cursor`'s filter re-wrap (`pgque.sql:2277`); cross-batch
  order follows from one subscription's monotonically-advancing cursor.
- **G2 — single in-flight processor per key.** At most one worker at a time is
  *issued* events of `K`, and in steady state at most one *processes* them. Two
  mechanisms compose: (1) the per-subscription receive lock (`next_batch_custom …
  for update of s`, `pgque.sql:5761`, the #97/#125 guard) serializes batch
  **issuance** — one active batch per slot; concurrent `receive()` returns that
  same batch idempotently, never a second independent batch; (2) the
  session-scoped slot **claim** (§15), held across the receive→process→ack loop,
  keeps a second session from polling the slot during the process→ack gap the
  receive lock does *not* span (§12). So the claim is **load-bearing for G2**, not
  distribution polish. If a claimant's connection dies mid-batch, the claim frees
  while the batch stays open and the next claimant is re-issued the same batch —
  at-least-once, with possible transient overlap with a zombie worker; handlers
  must tolerate redelivery.
- **G3 — failure boundary (Phase 2 / `pause`).** Under `pause`, no later event of
  `K` is delivered until `K`'s failed head event is acked or dead-lettered, and
  after it resolves the deferred events deliver in `ev_id` order, exactly once.
  Under `skip` (Phase 1 default), later events of `K` MAY arrive before the
  failure resolves — only at-least-once holds.
  - **Engine fact:** a retried event keeps its `ev_id`, gets a new `ev_txid`
    (re-injected by `maint_retry_events` → `insert_event_raw`, `pgque.sql:859`),
    and re-routes to the **same slot** because `ev_extra1` is preserved
    (`pgque.sql:861`). So G1's `ev_id` monotonicity holds only between non-retried
    events; across a retry the only ordering guarantee is G3's pause boundary.

## 3. Why it's needed

PgQue is an ordered, immutable **log**, not a job queue — workloads need
per-entity ordering without global ordering. Motivating case (a multi-tenant
storage service evaluating PgQue vs pg-boss): millions of file-lifecycle events
that **must be ordered per tenant** but need **no ordering across tenants**.

## 4. Scope and phasing

**Phase 1 — converged, build now:**
- Partition key on a `send()`-sourced event (D1, D6).
- N independent **slot consumers**, each filtering the stream to its hash class
  via `get_batch_cursor` `extra_where` (§6). Stable affinity (D4).
- G1 + G2. **`skip` failure policy** (stateless, sound).
- Persisted/enforced `N` (D3); slot identity + single-owner (D7); SECURITY
  DEFINER ownership model (§6).
- **Client-side claim assignment** (§15): workers self-distribute over the fixed
  `N` slots via a per-slot advisory try-lock — no leader, no assignor.

**Phase 2 — specified, follow-up (NOT converged):**
- **`pause` failure policy** (G3 strict). Needs a *defer-without-retry-increment*
  primitive that does not exist today (§11 O1), a durable blocked-key marker
  (D5), and carries the hot-blocked-key cost (§11 O2). Build after Phase 1.

**Out of scope:** producer idempotency (§12); dynamic `N` / rebalancing (R4);
**trigger-sourced queues** (triggers use `ev_extra1` for the table name — D1, R5);
cascaded/multi-node; automatic hot-partition mitigation.

**ICP:** multi-tenant SaaS on managed Postgres with a high-volume per-entity
event stream (entity = partition key).

## 5. End-to-end workflow

```
producer:  pgque.send('files', 'default', payload, partition_key => tenant_id)
                       │  key → ev_extra1 (send-sourced queues only)
                       ▼
engine:    append-only tables · global ev_id/ev_txid order   (UNCHANGED)
                       │  full stream
                       ▼
consumers: N slot consumers, each an INDEPENDENT subscription with its own cursor;
           slot k reads the whole stream, server-side-filtered to its hash class
```

## 6. Architecture

The mechanism is **N independent slot consumers**, not a modification of
cooperative consumers (round 1 B1: coop hands disjoint tick windows; confirmed
`pgque.sql:6262`). Each slot is its own subscription → own cursor + `sub_id` → no
cross-slot data loss; retry/DLQ rows are slot-scoped (`ev_owner = sub_id`,
`pgque.sql:2374`).

<!-- architecture:begin -->
```
 producers │ send(queue, type, payload, partition_key => K) → ev_extra1
           ▼
 ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ ENGINE · sacred — UNCHANGED                                │
 │ append-only tables · global ev_id/ev_txid · rotation      │
 │ next_batch / get_batch_cursor(i_extra_where) / order by 1 │
 └───────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬──────────────────┘
         ▼ full stream    ▼ full stream    ▼ full stream
   slot 0 (sub#0/N)  slot 1 (sub#1/N)  slot N-1
   own cursor        own cursor        own cursor
   filter h%N=0      filter h%N=1      filter h%N=N-1
```
<!-- architecture:end -->

**Filtering without touching the engine.** Each slot's receive reuses the
admin-only `pgque.get_batch_cursor(…, i_extra_where)` hook (`pgque.sql:2229`,
the 4-arg overload), injecting `and (hashtextextended(ev_extra1,0) % N + N) % N =
k`, assembled only from the validated integers `N`,`k` (§8). `batch_event_sql`,
`next_batch`, rotation are not modified; the filter re-wrap preserves G1.

**SECURITY DEFINER ownership (round 3 — corrected).** `get_batch_cursor`'s
`extra_where` is a trusted-SQL sink, revoked from `public/pgque_reader/
pgque_writer`, admin-only (`pgque.sql:2221`, `:4852`). `receive_partitioned` and
`subscribe_slot` reach it **because they are owned by the same role that owns
`get_batch_cursor` (the install owner) — a function owner may execute its own
functions regardless of grants.** This is *not* the `receive`/`nack` pattern
(those never call `get_batch_cursor`; they call reader-granted internals), and it
does *not* depend on the owner holding `pgque_admin`. **Invariant:** the
partition functions MUST be created by the same role that ran `\i pgque.sql`. On
managed Postgres the installer is a non-superuser admin role; co-ownership (not a
grant) is what makes the wrapper work — state and test this explicitly.

**Read amplification.** Every event is scanned by all `N` slot cursors (filter
applied after the engine materializes the window, `pgque.sql:2277` — reduces
returned rows, not scan work). ≈ N× steady; up to ~2N× during rotation overlap;
a stalled slot scans an ever-widening window. Documented; single-reader/dispatch
optimization is future (R6).

## 7. Decisions

| ID | Decision | Choice (v0.4) | Notes |
|----|----------|---------------|-------|
| D1 | Key location | `ev_extra1`, `send()`-sourced queues only | Triggers use `ev_extra1` for table name. |
| D2 | Failure policy | `skip` default (Phase 1); `pause` is Phase 2 (§11) | `pause` has open mechanics. |
| D3 | N | Fixed, persisted in `pgque.partition_consumer(queue, consumer, n)` (written inside SECURITY DEFINER `subscribe_slot`; table revoked from app roles); changed `n` rejected | Enforced invariant, not convention. |
| D4 | Assignment | `(hashtextextended(key,0) % N + N) % N` | Stable, sign-safe. |
| D5 | State budget | **Phase 1 / happy / `skip`: no state, no per-event writes.** **Phase 2 `pause`:** durable `pgque.partition_block(sub_id, partition_key, head_ev_id)` marker (FK `sub_id → subscription on delete cascade`; index `(sub_id, partition_key)`). Blocked keys additionally incur defer churn (§11 O1) — so "no per-event churn" is a Phase-1/non-blocked-key claim only. | Round 3 corrected the churn framing. |
| D6 | Producer signature | `send(queue, type, payload, partition_key => text)` | Avoids `send(queue,type,payload)` collision. |
| D7 | Slot, single-owner, key namespace | slot = consumer `"<consumer>#k/N"`; **G2 = receive lock (batch issuance) + session claim held across process→ack (§15)**; **`pgque.slot_lock_key(queue,consumer,k)` + `claim_slot`/`release_slot` are core** (one shared advisory-lock namespace so all clients agree); `partition_slot_status` view for owner+lag | Reader-callable; clients cannot diverge on the lock key. |
| D8 | Worker→slot assignment | Client-side **claim** (§15): non-blocking `pg_try_advisory_lock`; **no leader, no `PartitionAssignor`, no rebalance protocol.** Boundary follows the **mechanism/policy seam**: corruption-capable transitions → core SQL, guarded policy loops → client. | Kafka needs an assignor because partitions are exclusive *by protocol*; here the DB arbitrates per batch. |
| D9 | Online resize (grow N) | Epoch-gated **drain-then-cutover** state machine in **core SQL** (`begin_resize`/`resize_ready`/`complete_resize`/`abort_resize`); client drives the drain loop, core re-validates on cutover. Immutable N in Phase 1 (§15 → *Online resize*). | Grow-N reshuffles `hash%N` and breaks G1/G2 for in-flight keys (Fabrizio); the log-native analog of Kinesis parent-shard drain. |
| D10 | No member/heartbeat/lease table | **Rejected**, not just deferred: crash detection is free (session-death advisory-lock release — no `session.timeout.ms` to tune) and exclusivity is already G2. Observability via the read-only `pgque.partition_slot_status` view. | A lease table buys neither correctness nor recovery and re-adds heartbeat `UPDATE` churn. |

## 8. Implementation details

- **Producer:** `send(queue, type, payload, partition_key text default null)` →
  `insert_event(…, ev_extra1 => partition_key, …)`. SECURITY DEFINER, pinned
  search_path; revoke public, grant `pgque_writer`.
- **Tables (created in Phase 1, `if not exists`):** `partition_consumer`
  (N persistence) and `partition_block` (Phase-2 marker, empty in Phase 1 so
  test assertions are well-formed). Both revoked from app roles (the
  `dead_letter` pattern, `dlq.sql:236`); written only inside SECURITY DEFINER
  functions.
- **`subscribe_slot(queue, consumer, k int, n int)`:** validate `n>=1 and
  0<=k<n`; upsert persisted `n`, reject a changed `n` (D3); register
  `"<consumer>#k/n"`. Idempotent for the same `(k,n)`.
- **`receive_partitioned(queue, consumer, k int, n int, …)`:** after casting
  `k,n` to int, `next_batch` + `get_batch_cursor(…, i_extra_where =>
  format('and (hashtextextended(ev_extra1,0) %% %s + %s) %% %s = %s', n,n,n,k))`.
  SECURITY DEFINER (§6); granted `pgque_reader`. **Returns the current
  `partition_consumer.epoch`** so a handler can stamp it into side effects as a
  user-space **fencing token** (a zombie worker on an old epoch is then detectable
  downstream) — this is the consumer for the `epoch` column (D9, §15).
- **`pause` (Phase 2):** on nack of `K#i`, upsert `partition_block(sub_id, K,
  head_ev_id => ev_id)`. A later event of a blocked key (open marker with
  `head_ev_id < ev_id`) is **deferred** (see §11 O1 for the missing primitive),
  not server-side-dropped (dropping + cursor-advance would lose it). Clear the
  marker when `K#i` is acked, **or** when it is dead-lettered — DLQ-unblock
  predicate: a `dead_letter` row exists for `ev_id = K#i` and `dl_consumer_id`
  equal to this slot's `co_id`, where the slot's `co_id` is obtained by joining
  `subscription` (`partition_block.sub_id → subscription.sub_consumer =
  dead_letter.dl_consumer_id`) — `sub_id` and `co_id` are different ID spaces
  (`dlq.sql:24,75-85`, `pgque.sql:170-183`); do not compare them directly.
- **Teardown:** `unsubscribe_slot` removes the slot subscription (the
  `partition_block` FK cascades). Note `unregister_consumer` cascades
  `dead_letter` (`dlq.sql:24`), so dropping a slot drops its DLQ audit —
  documented.
- **Grants:** producer → `pgque_writer`; `subscribe_slot`/`unsubscribe_slot`/
  `receive_partitioned`/`slot_lock_key`/`claim_slot`/`release_slot` and `select` on
  `partition_slot_status` → `pgque_reader`; `partition_consumer`/`partition_block`
  revoked from all app roles; `get_batch_cursor` stays admin-only. Deny-by-default
  re-applied.

## 9. Tests plan (red/green TDD), CI PG 14–18

**Phase 1 (must pass to ship):**
- **T-G1a:** literal `(hashtextextended(K,0)%N+N)%N` on every CI version, pinning
  one concrete `(K, expected)` pair. *(red first)*
- **T-G1b:** interleave A,B,A,A,B → each key in `ev_id` order across batches, no
  key on two slots. (No existing test guards intra-batch `ev_id` order.)
- **T-retry-affinity:** nack a keyed event; `maint_retry_events()` +
  `force_next_tick` + `ticker()`; assert redelivery to the **same** slot only.
- **T-G2-block / T-G2-parallel:** same slot → second worker blocks (mirror
  `two_session_receive_lock.sh`); different slots → neither blocks.
- **T-no-drop:** keys across all slots in one window; all N slots; union = all
  events, zero loss.
- **T-security:** run against an install whose owner is a **non-superuser,
  non-`pgque_admin` role** — a bare `pgque_reader` can call
  `receive_partitioned`/`subscribe_slot` end-to-end, and **cannot** call
  `get_batch_cursor` directly (`42501`, mirror `test_security_get_batch_cursor.sql`);
  non-integer/out-of-range `n`,`k` rejected.
- **T-N-invariant:** `subscribe_slot(…,k,n)` idempotent; `(…,k,n2≠n)` raises.
- **T-claim (assignment):** two sessions take per-slot `pg_try_advisory_lock` over
  `N=2`; assert they land on **distinct** slots (disjoint locks), a third session
  gets neither, and releasing one frees exactly that slot for the third. Liveness
  only — correctness is already covered by T-G2-block.
- **T-no-bloat (happy path):** all-ack of M events → zero `retry_queue`/
  `dead_letter`/`partition_block` rows (guard the `partition_block` clause with
  `to_regclass('pgque.partition_block') is not null`) and no per-event
  UPDATE/DELETE.
- **T-engine-untouched:** `pg_get_functiondef` of `batch_event_sql`,
  `next_batch_custom`, and `get_batch_cursor/4` (pin the 4-arg overload)
  byte-identical to baseline.
- **T-idempotent-install:** re-running `pgque.sql` re-creates functions + the two
  new tables (`create table/unique index if not exists`) cleanly.

**Phase 2 (`pause`) — write when O1/O2 (§11) resolve:**
- **T-G3-pause:** A#2 nacked; drive maint+tick; A#3 withheld until A#2
  acked-or-DLQ'd; **and after unblock A#2 then A#3 deliver in `ev_id` order,
  exactly once**; B unaffected.
- **T-DLQ-unblock:** A#2 exhausts retries → `dead_letter`; assert the
  `partition_block` row for A drops to 0 **via the DLQ branch (no ack ever
  occurred)** and A#3 then proceeds.
- **T-slot-crash:** worker holding A#2 dies; assert the `partition_block` row is
  present after the crash and before the new worker's first receive (durability);
  drive maint+tick; A#2 redelivered before A#3, only to slot k. Crash in the
  post-`maint` window (retry_queue row already gone).
- **T-hot-blocked-key:** hot `K` blocked under `pause` → other slots unaffected;
  defer cost is bounded by `K`'s backlog until DLQ, not total throughput.

## 10. Risks

- **R2 — read amplification:** N× steady, ~2N× rotation overlap, widening for a
  stalled slot. Benchmark the stalled case.
- **R3 — hot partitions:** documented only.
- **R4 — changing N / over-provisioning:** N is an enforced invariant (D3) **and**
  the read-amplification multiplier (§6 — every slot scans the full stream), so
  inflating N to dodge a future resize is **not free**: it linearly raises steady
  read cost. Online resize breaks order for in-flight keys — `(hash % N)` reshuffles
  keys across slots (Fabrizio's point) — so you must **drain the old epoch first**;
  the sanctioned protocol is the epoch-gated drain-then-cutover in §15 (*Online
  resize*, D9), not a hand-wave. Phase 1 guidance: **immutable N**, chosen to match
  the parallelism you need, bounded by the read-amp budget.
- **R5 — `ev_extra1`:** send-sourced queues only.
- **R6 — single-reader/dispatch** to remove read amplification; future.
- **R7 — rotation pinning (first-class risk, not a footnote):** rotation waits
  for `min(sub_last_tick)` over ALL subscriptions (`pgque.sql:910`), so N slots
  lower the rotation floor to the **slowest** slot. One stalled or lagging slot
  pins rotation for the whole queue, old event tables stop being dropped, and the
  log grows — i.e. **the bloat pgque exists to avoid comes back with nicer
  names.** This is the sharpest operational hazard of the N-slot model and gets
  worse as N grows (more slots → more chances one is behind). Mitigation is
  monitoring + bounding N, not code: a per-slot staleness/lag alert is mandatory
  for any Tier-B deployment, and N should be the minimum that meets the
  parallelism target (see R2/R4 — N is also the read-amp multiplier, so the same
  "keep N small" pressure applies from two directions). A `pause`-blocked slot
  does *not* pin rotation (deferred events go to retry, not the held cursor),
  **but** a hot blocked key keeps that slot perpetually lagging, so the alert
  cannot by itself distinguish "wedged" from "hot key under pause".

## 11. Open design items — Phase 2 `pause` (why it's a follow-up)

- **O1 — defer-without-retry-increment primitive (blocking for `pause`).**
  `finish_batch` acks the whole batch, so withholding `K#i+1` requires removing it
  from the batch. A **server-side filter that lets the cursor advance would lose
  it** (round-2 data-loss). `event_retry` preserves it but **increments
  `ev_retry`**, so a long-blocked key's deferred events would falsely march toward
  `max_retries`/DLQ. `pause` therefore needs a new "re-queue without counting as a
  retry" path (or a hold-cursor design that doesn't wedge rotation). Undecided.
- **O2 — hot-blocked-key cost.** Until O1 is settled, a hot blocked key makes its
  slot re-defer a growing backlog each poll (per-event churn for that key,
  bounded by the head's time-to-DLQ). Acceptable for rare failures (the migration
  ICP); needs documentation + T-hot-blocked-key before `pause` ships.

## 12. Relationship to producer idempotency (separate feature)

Producer dedup is a TTL window (SQS/NATS), append-only, GC'd by rotation — a
**separate, orthogonal send-layer feature**, not a tier of this spec. Feature
spec: `blueprints/idempotency/SPEC.md`; rationale: `…/DESIGN.md`. It ships as
**Phase 1B** (independent of partition-keys 1A).

**The migration use case is not a partition-keys use case.** It is a plain-queue
recipe = producer TTL dedup (1B) + consumer mutual exclusion (per-key advisory
lock + idempotent handler). It needs no slots, no fixed N, and no ordering — the
"partition key" there is a *lock key*, not a partition. Keeping migrations out of
this feature is deliberate: it stops the partition-keys design from drifting
toward a mutable job queue (pg-boss with extra steps).

**Why two plain workers on one consumer is unsafe (the caller's responsibility).**
The receive lock (`for update of s`) is released at the `next_batch` transaction
commit — **not** held across the process→ack gap. So the engine *does* coordinate
(a second `receive()` blocks, then idempotently returns the *same* active batch —
`two_session_receive_lock.sh`; there is no distinct-batch double-delivery), but if
worker A opens a batch in autocommit and goes off to process, worker B's
`receive()` can pick up that same still-open batch and reprocess the same events.
That is redundant reprocessing of **one** batch under PgQ's one-active-batch-per-
`(queue,consumer)` model — fixed not by an external coordinator but by giving each
parallel worker its own cursor (cooperative subconsumers, or a partition slot), or
the per-key advisory-lock recipe above.

## 13. Review panel

- **Lead:** drafts/revises.
- **Reviewer A — ops/security** · **Reviewer B — QA/testability.** Rounds 1–3
  applied. Round 3 verdict: Phase 1 converged; Phase 2 (`pause`) has open items
  O1/O2 → split out as follow-up.

## 14. Sprint plan

1. **S1 — producer + key plumbing** (+ the two tables, empty). T-G1a,
   T-no-bloat(happy), T-idempotent-install.
2. **S2 — slot consumers (`skip`), SECURITY DEFINER + co-ownership, persisted N.**
   T-G1b, T-retry-affinity, T-G2-block/parallel, T-no-drop, T-security,
   T-N-invariant, T-engine-untouched. **← Phase 1 ships here.**
3. **S3 — `pause` (Phase 2), gated on O1/O2.** T-G3-pause, T-DLQ-unblock,
   T-slot-crash, T-hot-blocked-key.
4. **S4 — docs + benchmark** (read-amp: steady/rotation/stalled; per-tenant order).

## 15. Worker → slot assignment

Slots are **claimed, not assigned.** There is no consumer-group leader, no
`PartitionAssignor`, and no stop-the-world rebalance protocol — Kafka needs all
three because a partition is exclusive *by protocol* (the broker hands it to one
member, with no per-message arbitration). Here the **database is the
coordinator**, so assignment is pull-based and self-balancing.

**Claim loop (client-side).** Each worker iterates candidate slots `0..N-1` and
attempts a non-blocking `pg_try_advisory_lock(pgque.slot_lock_key(queue, consumer,
k))` — `slot_lock_key` is a **core** stateless function (D7) so Go/Python/TS/CLI
share one advisory-lock namespace and cannot silently collide on a slot. The
first slot it locks, it owns: it calls `receive_partitioned(queue, consumer, k, N,
…)` for that slot and keeps it **sticky-until-idle** (re-poll the same slot while
it has work; release the advisory lock **only at a batch boundary** — after
ack/finish — on drain or shutdown, since releasing mid-batch hands the successor
the same still-open batch (§12); on shutdown, finish or explicitly abandon the
open batch first). On a failed try-lock
the worker moves to the next slot — it never blocks waiting on a busy slot.

- **Symmetric (N workers, N slots).** Each worker locks one distinct slot; the
  try-lock makes ownership disjoint with zero coordination. Sequential per-key
  consumption follows from G1 (routing) + the single owner.
- **Fan-in (N slots, M<N workers).** Each worker cycles its claim loop and holds
  ≈⌈N/M⌉ slots.
- **Scale-up (M → M′ workers).** New workers run the same loop and lock whatever
  slots are unclaimed or get released at a batch boundary. No revocation, no
  leader recompute — convergence to ≈N/M′ slots per worker within one claim cycle.
- **Scale-down / crash.** The dead session's advisory lock is released by Postgres,
  so its slots are immediately reclaimable — there is no `session.timeout.ms`
  equivalent and no rebalance to trigger.

**Two locks, different jobs.**

- **G2 receive lock** (`for update of s` on the subscription, *blocking*, §2)
  protects the **log and cursor**: one active batch per slot; concurrent
  `receive()` returns the *same* batch idempotently (§12); the cursor advances
  only on ack. No client behavior can obtain two divergent batches, lose events,
  or reorder *delivery*.
- **Advisory slot claim** (session-scoped, non-blocking `try`, held across
  receive→process→ack) protects **processing exclusivity** — it closes the
  process→ack gap the receive lock does not span, and is therefore *load-bearing
  for G2's "single in-flight processor," not pure liveness.* A client that skips
  it can put two workers concurrently on the same open batch: redundant
  reprocessing plus interleaved same-key side effects (an effect-level order
  violation) — though never event loss, never cursor corruption, never cross-slot
  damage; at-least-once always holds. Even spread is the same lock's second job.

**What claiming does not give you.** Even spread under *key skew*: a hot slot
stays hot no matter who owns it (R3). First-free claiming can be made fairer with
**lag-aware claiming** (prefer the free slot with the oldest unconsumed `ev_id`) —
a future refinement, not Phase 1.

**N bounds the fan-out.** Assignment distributes a *fixed* N (D3) over a variable
worker count: useful parallelism is capped at N (workers > N sit idle), and
because N is also the read-amplification multiplier (§6, R4), N is chosen to match
the parallelism you need — not inflated "to be safe." Growing N online is the
*Online resize* protocol below.

**Every slot must be polled (hard requirement, not fairness polish).** With M<N
workers, sticky first-free claiming can leave a slot **unclaimed and unpolled**;
its cursor stalls, and by R7 a stalled slot pins rotation for the *whole queue* →
the append-only log grows unbounded (clean, but growth). So a Tier-B deployment
MUST guarantee every slot is polled within a bounded interval — either M ≥ N, or a
claim policy that cycles idle slots, or lag-aware claiming (below). This is a
correctness-adjacent operational invariant, monitored via `partition_slot_status`
+ the mandatory R7 lag alert.

### Where coordination lives — mechanism vs policy (Fabrizio review)

Cut the core/client boundary along the **mechanism/policy seam**, not the feature.
Everything a *wrong client could use to corrupt shared state* lives in **core SQL**,
written once and guarded; everything *idempotent-safe* (which slot to grab, poll
cadence, when to resize) lives in the **client** or **user space**, where a bug
can degrade one worker's spread, stall, or cause duplicate/interleaved processing
on the *one slot it targets* — but can never corrupt the log, the cursor, or
another slot (which is exactly why the *claim helpers* are core, D7). Same
two-lock discipline as above: the log/cursor ride a blocking lock the DB always
enforces; per-slot processing exclusivity + distribution ride the session claim.

- **Core SQL (mechanism):** the receive lock (G2), the hash-routing filter, the
  enforced N (D3), the shared `slot_lock_key`/`claim_slot`/`release_slot`, the
  read-only `partition_slot_status` view, and the resize state machine (below).
- **Client library (policy):** the claim loop, the receive→ack loop, the resize
  drain-driver. A buggy loop loses spread or stalls; it cannot corrupt order.
- **User space (policy):** choosing N, static-pin-vs-claim, the plain-queue
  mutual-exclusion recipe (§12), when/whether to resize, and the R7 lag alert.

**No member/heartbeat/lease table in core (D10) — rejected as redundant.** A
lease/heartbeat table (Kafka group coordinator, Kinesis KCL DynamoDB lease table)
does two jobs pgque already does better: (1) **crash detection** — a Postgres
session-scoped advisory lock releases when the connection dies — with no
app-layer `leaseDuration`/`session.timeout.ms` to tune. (Two honest caveats: a
*silent* partition holds the lock + open batch until TCP keepalive fires — so
worker connections should set `tcp_keepalives_idle/interval/count` or
`tcp_user_timeout`, the one real knob; and lock-release ≠ process-death, so a
partitioned worker can still emit side effects while the successor is re-issued
the same open batch — the same zombie class as a lease, just a narrower window and
without the churn. Fencing token: `receive_partitioned` returns the `epoch` so
handlers can stamp it, §8.) (2) **exclusive ownership** — the receive lock +
sticky session claim across process→ack (G2, §2), not the receive lock alone. It buys neither, and adds heartbeat `UPDATE` churn
(the per-row bloat pgque exists to avoid) plus TTL/clock tuning. Its one genuine
benefit — *who owns what, how far behind* — is delivered writeless by
**`pgque.partition_slot_status`**, a read-only view over `pg_locks` (owner pid) +
subscription cursors (per-slot lag) + resize state. An externalized lease record
stays a **user-space opt-in**, never a correctness or recovery dependency.

**Connection-pooler caveat (matters for the Supabase ICP).** The claim is a
*session-scoped* advisory lock held sticky across batches (a `txn`-scoped lock
can't — it must span receive→process→ack). Under **transaction-mode pooling**
(PgBouncer/Supavisor transaction mode — Supabase's default) it doesn't merely fail
to persist: it **leaks onto the pooled backend**, which keeps holding it while
serving other clients → the slot looks permanently owned and every other worker's
try-lock fails until that backend recycles (a wedge, not just a miss). Cheaper
shape than "all-session-mode": only the **claim-holding** connection must be
session-mode/direct; `receive_partitioned`/ack traffic can stay on the transaction
pooler — materially easier where direct connections are scarce (same zombie
semantics if the claim connection alone dies). Document as a Phase-1 constraint;
if an ICP genuinely can't hold one session connection per worker, an opt-in
user-space lease is the fallback — not core schema.

### Online resize — grow N without breaking order (D9, Phase 3)

> **Status: draft protocol — must pass its own review round before Phase 3 build.**
> The v0.7 refinement review corrected an earlier `ev_id`-gated sketch (which had an
> abort-path data-loss hole and a watermark type conflation) to the **tick-window**

The leverage: pgque partitions are a *read-side filter over one append-only log*.
A resize moves **no data** and **never blocks producers** (the log has no N) — only
*which cursor reads which hash class* is re-derived. So grow-N is a clean
drain-then-cutover watermark (the log-native analog of Kinesis parent-shard drain).
State on `partition_consumer(…, epoch, resize_state, n_next, seal_tick)`,
`resize_state ∈ {stable, draining}`; all writes SECURITY DEFINER, table revoked
from app roles.

**The boundary is a tick, not an ev_id.** Old epoch = events in tick windows ≤
`seal_tick`; new epoch = windows > `seal_tick`. An in-flight producer txn holding
a low `ev_id` that commits post-seal lands in a *post-seal window* → new epoch,
consumed post-cutover in window order — identical to the engine's existing
cross-txn window semantics, so there is no straggler special case and no dual
watermark.

| Step | What happens | Lives in |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `begin_resize(q,c,N′)` | assert `stable`; require a live ticker; `force_tick`, record `seal_tick`; `n_next=N′`, `resize_state=draining`. Register the N′ new slots at `seal_tick` (`register_consumer_at`, `pgque.sql:1782`). | core; operator/CLI |
| drain | old slots consume normally but are **server-side gated to windows ≤ `seal_tick`** (`receive_partitioned` refuses to open a batch past the seal, and caps the batch window regardless of `min_count`/`min_interval`, which could otherwise overshoot). New slots return empty **without calling `next_batch`** — cursor parked at `seal_tick`, so the gate never advances them past the backlog. | core filter; client drives tick+poll |
| `resize_ready(q,c)→bool` | true iff every old slot has `sub_last_tick = seal_tick`, no open batch, **and zero `retry_queue` rows** owned by old-slot `sub_id`s (nor `partition_block` under pause). Retry-flush is mandatory: `unregister_consumer` deletes retry rows, so a naive flip drops nacked-pending events. | core guard |
| `complete_resize(q,c)` | takes `for update` on the old-slot subscription rows (the same lock `next_batch_custom` holds, `pgque.sql:5761`) so no batch can open between re-check and cutover; **re-checks `resize_ready`, refuses if false**; sets `n=N′`, `epoch+1`, `stable`, clears `seal_tick`; unsubscribes old slots **re-homing their `dead_letter` rows** (per-row re-hash `hash(ev_extra1)%N′` → new slot's `co_id`, or a queue archive consumer — a bare `unregister_consumer` cascades DLQ history away). | core |
| `abort_resize(q,c)` | drop the gate, unsubscribe the N′ slots, back to `stable`. **Loss-free by construction** — under tick-gating the old slots never advanced past `seal_tick`, so nothing new-epoch was skipped. | core |

The operator/CLI calls `begin_resize`; a **client drain-driver** loops
`tick()`+`resize_ready()` until true-or-timeout, then `complete_resize`/`abort_resize`.
Because cutover re-validates atomically under the subscription-row lock, a buggy
driver can only **stall** (state stays `draining`, old epoch keeps working) — never
cut over early. R7 during resize: both slot sets pin rotation while draining
(bounded, released at cutover); a wedged old slot keeps `resize_ready` false — it
stalls the resize and trips the lag alert, never corrupts. **Shrink N** is the
machine run backward, deferred. Cannot resize under `pause` until O1 (a blocked
key never drains).

## 16. Changelog

- **v0.7 (draft):** Fabrizio review (he tested the repro) + advisor + workflow.
  Corrected the receive-lock claim (core *does* coordinate; the real hazard is the
  process→ack gap, §12) — verified in `pgque.sql:5761/5798/5866/5905` +
  `two_session_receive_lock.sh`. Stated the **mechanism/policy seam** (D8) and made
  the **member/heartbeat table an explicit rejection** (D10) — redundant with
  session-death lock release + G2 — replaced by core `slot_lock_key` (D7) +
  read-only `partition_slot_status` view. Added the **connection-pooler caveat**
  (session advisory locks need session-mode/direct connections — the Supabase
  ICP). Upgraded R4 from hand-wave to the sanctioned **epoch-gated drain-then-
  cutover online-resize** protocol (D9, §15) with retry-flush + DLQ-preservation
  guards, modeled on Kinesis parent-shard drain. Promoted "every slot must be
  polled" to a hard R7-adjacent requirement.
  - *Refinement pass (Fable review of v0.7):* propagated the receive-lock
    correction into G2/§15/brief — the **session claim is load-bearing for G2, not
    pure liveness** (skipping it → duplicate/interleaved processing of one batch);
    claim releases only at a batch boundary. Reworked online resize from `ev_id`-
    gating to **tick-window gating** (fixes the abort-path data-loss hole + the
    `ev_seal` type conflation; `abort_resize` now loss-free by construction).
    Sharpened D10/pooling: session-lock **leaks onto the pooled backend** under
    transaction pooling (wedge, not miss) — only the claim connection needs
    session-mode; a silent partition needs `tcp_keepalives_*`. Gave `epoch` a job
    (fencing token returned by `receive_partitioned`). Marked the resize protocol
    "draft — needs its own review round before Phase 3 build."
- **v0.6 (draft):** review (Max / consumer Q&A). **Scoped this feature to ordered
  per-key streams only** — producer idempotency split into its own send-layer
  feature (`blueprints/idempotency/SPEC.md`, Phase 1B) and the migration use case
  reframed as a plain-queue recipe (dedup + mutual exclusion), explicitly *not* a
  partition-keys use case (§12). Promoted **rotation pinning** to a first-class
  risk (R7) — N slots lower the rotation floor to the slowest slot, the bloat
  pgque exists to avoid; per-slot lag alert mandatory, bound N. Roadmap reframed
  to 1A (slots) / 1B (producer dedup) / 2 (read-amp) / 3 (pause).
- **v0.5 (draft):** added the **worker→slot assignment** model (§15, D8):
  client-side **claim** via a non-blocking per-slot `pg_try_advisory_lock` — no
  leader, no `PartitionAssignor`, no rebalance protocol; G2's blocking receive
  lock is the correctness backstop, the advisory lock only distributes; crash
  recovery is just session-death lock release (no `session.timeout.ms`).
  Clarified that fixed N (D3) is also the read-amp multiplier, so over-provisioning
  N to avoid a resize is **not free** and online resize breaks G1 mid-flight (R4
  expanded). Added T-claim (assignment liveness).
- **v0.4 (draft):** review round 3. **Phase 1 declared converged /
  implementation-ready; `pause` split into Phase 2** with explicit open items
  (§11 O1 defer-without-retry-increment, O2 hot-blocked-key). Corrected the
  SECURITY DEFINER justification to the **co-ownership** invariant (not
  `pgque_admin`; not "like receive/nack") + non-superuser-owner security test
  (round 3 B1). Fixed the DLQ-unblock `sub_id`↔`co_id` join; added
  `partition_block` FK-cascade + index + revoked-from-roles; tables created empty
  in Phase 1; `T-no-bloat` guarded with `to_regclass`; `T-engine-untouched` pins
  the `/4` overload; `T-G3-pause` now asserts in-order-exactly-once after unblock;
  `T-DLQ-unblock` asserts marker-clear-via-DLQ; `T-slot-crash` asserts marker
  durability; added `T-hot-blocked-key`. Round-3 detail in `decisions.md`.
- **v0.3:** round 2 — confirmed G1 ordering + G2 lock real; SECURITY DEFINER
  wiring; durable `partition_block`; modulo sign fix; R7.
- **v0.2:** round 1 — N independent slot subscriptions; G1/G2/G3; `skip` default.
- **v0.1:** initial SamoSpec-format draft.
