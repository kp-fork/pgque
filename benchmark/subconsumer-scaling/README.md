# Subconsumer scaling demo

Focused benchmark + visualization harness for the `250 ms / message` story.

One consumer fetches a PgQue batch, then hands message processing to an in-process
pool of **subconsumers**. Each subconsumer sleeps for a fixed amount of time per
message to emulate a transactional email API call — think Resend or SendGrid.

The point is simple: when downstream work costs ~250 ms per message, a single
worker tops out at ~4 messages / second. More subconsumers drain the same
backlog faster.

## What it measures

- **Throughput** — events consumed per second, parsed from `NOTICE:`-style logs
- **Backlog** — `preloaded_messages - cumulative_consumed`
- **Drain time** — wall time from consumer start until the backlog reaches zero
- **Scaling efficiency** — observed throughput vs. the ideal `workers / sleep_s`

## Quick start

```bash
cd benchmark/subconsumer-scaling
python3 run.py \
  --dsn postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/bench \
  --message-count 1000 \
  --sleep-ms 250 \
  --workers 1,2,4,8,16
```

Outputs land under `/tmp/bench_subc/` by default:

## Queue flow

For each worker count:

1. drop + recreate a fresh queue
2. create an initial tick
3. subscribe one main consumer
4. preload all messages with `pgque.send_batch()`
5. `force_next_tick()` + `ticker()` once, so the backlog becomes visible in one batch
6. run one consumer process with an internal thread pool of `N` subconsumers
7. parse `NOTICE: ev ts=<epoch_s> n=1` lines into `events_consumed_per_sec.csv`
8. derive backlog and summaries

## Why one forced tick

This demo is about **consumer-side scaling**, not producer cadence. Everything is
preloaded before one forced tick, so every worker-count run drains the same
backlog from the same starting line.
