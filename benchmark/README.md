# pgque benchmark harness

The whole bench rig: how we compared pgque against pgq, pgmq, pgmq-partitioned, river, que, pg-boss, and **awa** (R10) under held-xmin pathology conditions on AWS i4i.2xlarge.

Backs [NikolayS/pgque#61](https://github.com/NikolayS/pgque/issues/61) (the held-xmin bloat issue) and [PR #62](https://github.com/NikolayS/pgque/pull/62) (the subscription/tick rotation fix). Round-by-round results are tracked at GitLab issue [postgres-ai/postgresql-consulting/tests-and-benchmarks#77](https://gitlab.com/postgres-ai/postgresql-consulting/tests-and-benchmarks/-/issues/77).

## Start here

- **[Throughput harness](./)** — cross-system benchmark harness and results.
- **[subconsumer-scaling](subconsumer-scaling/)** — focused demo for the `250 ms / message` story: one PgQue consumer, in-process subconsumers, backlog drain, charts, and GIF output.
- **[xmin-horizon](xmin-horizon/)** — blocked-xmin/dead-tuple repro comparing `SKIP LOCKED` queues with PgQue rotation.
- **[METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md)** — full bench methodology, workload shape, observability stack, phase scheduler.
- **[OPS_GOTCHAS.md](OPS_GOTCHAS.md)** — every operational lesson from running this on AWS (NVMe mount, pg_partman stale rows, que function leftovers, pgboss index, etc.).
- **[HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md)** — i4i.2xlarge specs, PG tuning, expected microbench baselines.

## Credit

The pathology this bench exercises is the one Brandur Leach documented in [Postgres Queues (2015)](https://brandur.org/postgres-queues) — DELETE-based queues become unvacuumably bloated under held xmin, and the DB-level death spiral that follows. The bench is a controlled reproduction of that scenario across seven queue systems.

## Quick-start

```bash
# on the VM, after bootstrap:
bash install/install_<sys>.sh            # system-specific install (incl. install_awa.sh for R10)
bash runners/run_r10.sh <sys>            # R10 orchestrator: 50m per system; dispatches Python workers for awa, pgbench for the others
# (R7 orchestrator runners/run_r7.sh kept for the 90m bloat-saw-tooth schedule)

# outputs (all under /tmp/bench/):
#   producer_agg.*                       pgbench producer aggregate log
#   consumer_agg.*                       pgbench consumer aggregate log
#   consumer.log                         NOTICE-instrumented per-call event counts
#   bloat.csv                            pg_stat_user_tables every 30 s
#   sys_metrics.csv                      CPU/mem/disk every 10 s
#   pgss_timeseries.csv                  pg_stat_statements every 10 s
#   ash.csv                              pg_ash 1 Hz wait-event samples (harvested at end)
#   pgfr_snapshots.csv                   pg-flight-recorder snapshots (harvested at end)
#   pgfr_table_snapshots.csv             pgfr table-level snapshots
#   pgfr_statement_snapshots.csv         pgfr per-statement snapshots
#   events_consumed_per_sec.csv          parsed from consumer.log
```

Example instrumented consumer: [consumers/consumer_pgque.sql](consumers/consumer_pgque.sql).

ASH and pgfr output (`ash.csv`, `pgfr_snapshots.csv`) land in `/tmp/bench/` post-run when the harvest step of `run_r7.sh` completes.

## Scope

Only a harness. Produces no test coverage for pgque itself — that lives under `tests/` in the main repo. This directory adds nothing to the pgque production SQL; it is pure ops tooling + docs.
