Discussion on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47817349).

*For teams who want a durable event stream inside Postgres. The model is closer to Kafka (log) than to ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ (task message queue). Shared event log, independent per-consumer cursors, zero bloat under sustained load. Pure SQL and PL/pgSQL, any Postgres 14+ — managed or self-hosted, no sidecar daemon. The rest of this README walks the history, comparison, and install paths that back up the claim.*

PgQue brings back [PgQ](https://github.com/pgq/pgq) — one of the longest-running Postgres queue architectures in production — in a form that runs on any Postgres platform, managed providers included.

PgQ was designed at Skype to run messaging for hundreds of millions of users, and it ran on large self-managed Postgres deployments for over a decade. Standard PgQ depends on a C extension (`pgq`) and an external daemon (`pgqd`), neither of which run on most managed Postgres providers.

PgQue rebuilds that battle-tested engine in pure PL/pgSQL, so the zero-bloat queue pattern works anywhere you can run SQL — without adding another distributed system to your stack.

**The anti-extension.** Pure SQL + PL/pgSQL on any Postgres 14+ — including RDS, Aurora, Cloud SQL, AlloyDB, Supabase, Neon, and most other managed providers. No C extension, no `shared_preload_libraries`, no provider approval, no restart.

Historical context, two decks:

- [Marko Kreen (Skype), PGCon 2009 — PgQ](https://www.pgcon.org/2009/schedule/attachments/91_pgq.pdf)
- [Alexander Kukushkin (Microsoft), 2026 — Rediscovering PgQ](https://speakerdeck.com/cyberdemn/rediscovering-pgq)

## Why PgQue

Most Postgres queues rely on `SKIP LOCKED` plus `DELETE` and/or `UPDATE`. That holds up in toy examples and then turns into dead tuples, VACUUM pressure, index bloat, and performance drift under sustained load.

PgQue avoids that whole class of problems. It uses **snapshot-based batching** and **TRUNCATE-based table rotation** instead of per-row deletion. The hot path stays predictable:

- **Zero bloat by design** — no dead tuples in the main queue path
- **No performance decay** — it does not get slower because it has been running for months
- **Built for heavy-loaded systems** — the sustained-load regime the original PgQ architecture was designed for
- **Real Postgres guarantees** — ACID transactions, transactional enqueue/consume, WAL, backups, replication, SQL visibility
- **Works on managed Postgres** — no custom build, no C extension, no separate daemon

PgQue gives you queue semantics **inside** Postgres, with Postgres durability and transactional behavior, without the bloat tax most in-database queues eventually hit.

## Latency trade-off

PgQue is built around **snapshot-based batching**, not row-by-row claiming. That's what gives it zero bloat in the hot path, stable behavior under sustained load, and clean ACID semantics inside Postgres.

The trade-off is **end-to-end delivery latency** — the gap between `send` and when a consumer can `receive` the event. In the default configuration, end-to-end delivery typically lands within ~1–2 seconds: up to 1 s for the next tick, plus the consumer's poll interval. Per-call latency (the `send` / `receive` / `ack` functions themselves) stays in the microsecond range.

Ways to reduce delivery latency: tune tick frequency and queue thresholds; use `force_tick()` for tests and demos or to force an immediate batch. Future versions may add logical-decoding-based wake-ups for sub-second delivery without cutting the tick interval.

If your top priority is single-digit-millisecond dispatch, PgQue is the wrong tool. If your priority is **stability under load without bloat**, that is where PgQue fits.

## Three latencies

"Queue latency" is three numbers, not one:

1. **Producer latency** — `send` / `insert_event`. Sub-ms.
2. **Subscriber latency** — `next_batch` over a pre-built batch. Sub-ms.
3. **End-to-end delivery** — `send` → consumer visibility. ≈ tick period. Tunable, not floored. Does not grow with load.

See [docs/three-latencies.md](docs/three-latencies.md) for the breakdown, tick-cadence trade-off table, and comparison with UPDATE/DELETE-based designs.

## Comparison

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Snapshot-based batching (no row locks) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Zero bloat under sustained load | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Legend:** ✅ yes · ❌ no · ⚠️ partial / indirect

**Notes:**

- **[PgQ](https://github.com/pgq/pgq)** is the Skype-era queue engine (~2007) PgQue is derived from. Same snapshot/rotation architecture, but requires C extensions and an external daemon (`pgqd`) — unavailable on managed Postgres. PgQue removes both constraints.
- **No external daemon:** PgQue uses pg_cron (or your own scheduler) for ticking; PGMQ uses visibility timeouts. River, Que, and pg-boss require a Go / Ruby / Node.js worker binary.
- **[Que](https://github.com/que-rb/que)** uses advisory locks (not SKIP LOCKED) — no dead tuples from *claiming*, but completed jobs are still DELETEd. Brandur's [bloat post](https://brandur.org/postgres-queues) was about Que at Heroku. Ruby-only.
- **PGMQ retry** is visibility-timeout re-delivery (`read_ct` tracking) — no configurable backoff or max attempts.
- **pg-boss fan-out** is copy-per-queue `publish()`/`subscribe()`, not a shared event log with independent cursors.
- **Category:** River, Que, and pg-boss (and Oban, graphile-worker, solid_queue, good_job) are **job queue frameworks**. PgQue is an **event/message queue** optimized for high-throughput streaming with fan-out.

### What differentiates PgQue

**1. Zero event-table bloat, by design.** SKIP LOCKED queues (PGMQ, River, pg-boss, Oban, graphile-worker) UPDATE + DELETE rows, creating dead tuples that require VACUUM. Under sustained load this causes documented failures:

- [Brandur/Heroku (2015)](https://brandur.org/postgres-queues) — 60k backlog in one hour.
- [PlanetScale (2026)](https://planetscale.com/blog/keeping-a-postgres-queue-healthy) — death spiral at 800 jobs/sec with OLAP on the side.
- [River issue #59](https://github.com/riverqueue/river/issues/59) — autovacuum starvation.

Oban Pro shipped table partitioning to mitigate it; PGMQ ships aggressive autovacuum settings. PgQue's TRUNCATE rotation creates zero dead tuples by construction. No tuning. Immune to xmin horizon pinning.

**2. Native fan-out.** Each registered consumer maintains its own cursor on a shared event log and independently receives all events. That is different from competing-consumers (SKIP LOCKED) where each job goes to one worker. pg-boss has fan-out but it is copy-per-queue (one INSERT per subscriber per event). PgQue's model is a position on a shared log — no data duplication, atomic batch boundaries, late subscribers catch up. Closer to Kafka topics than to a job queue.

### When to use PgQue vs. a job queue

- **Choose PgQue** when you want event-driven fan-out, no bloat to tune around, and a language-agnostic SQL API, and you do not need per-job priorities or a worker framework.
- **Choose a job queue** when you need per-job lifecycle, sub-3ms latency, priority queues, cron scheduling, unique jobs, or deep ecosystem integration (Elixir/Go/Node.js/Ruby).

## Installation

**Requirements:** Postgres 14+, and something that calls `pgque.ticker()` periodically (every 1 second by default). `pg_cron` is the recommended default — pre-installed or one-command available on all major managed Postgres providers (RDS, Aurora, Cloud SQL, AlloyDB, Supabase, Neon); on self-managed Postgres, follow the [pg_cron setup guide](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron#setting-up-pg_cron). Any external scheduler (system `cron`, systemd, a worker loop in your app) works as an alternative — see below.

Get the source — `\i sql/pgque.sql` resolves relative to the cwd, so run psql from the repo root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikolayS/pgque
cd pgque
```

Inside a psql session:

```sql
begin;
\i sql/pgque.sql
commit;
```

Or from the shell, same single-transaction guarantee via `psql --single-transaction`:

```bash
PAGER=cat psql --no-psqlrc --single-transaction -d mydb -f sql/pgque.sql
```

With `pg_cron` available in the same database as PgQue, `pgque.start()` creates the default ticker and maintenance jobs:

```sql
select pgque.start();
```

**pg_cron in a different database.** `pg_cron` runs jobs in one designated database (`cron.database_name`, typically `postgres`). If your PgQue schema lives in a different database, use the [cross-database pattern](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron#creating-a-cron-job-in-a-different-database) to call `pgque.ticker()`, `pgque.maint_retry_events()`, and `pgque.maint()` across databases. *Todo: a future release will detect this and emit the correct `cron.schedule_in_database` calls from `pgque.start()` automatically.*

**pg_cron log hygiene.** The ticker runs every second, adding ~3,600 rows per hour to `cron.job_run_details` with no built-in purge. Set `alter system set cron.log_run = off;` globally, or schedule a periodic purge — see [the tutorial](docs/tutorial.md#production-cadence-use-pg_cron) for both recipes.

Without `pg_cron`, PgQue still installs. Drive ticking and maintenance from your application or an external scheduler:

```bash
PAGER=cat psql --no-psqlrc -d mydb -c "select pgque.ticker()"              # every 1 second
PAGER=cat psql --no-psqlrc -d mydb -c "select pgque.maint_retry_events()"  # every 30 seconds
PAGER=cat psql --no-psqlrc -d mydb -c "select pgque.maint()"               # every 30 seconds
```

**Important:** PgQue does not deliver messages without a working ticker. Enqueueing still works, but consumers will see nothing new because no ticks are created. If you do not use `pg_cron`, run `pgque.ticker()`, `pgque.maint_retry_events()`, and `pgque.maint()` yourself. Skipping `maint_retry_events()` means nack'd events will never be redelivered.

Treat installation as one-way for now — upgrade and reinstall paths are still being tightened. To uninstall: `\i sql/pgque_uninstall.sql`.

## Roles and grants

The install creates three roles. Application users do not need superuser — grant them whichever role matches their access pattern.

PgQue mirrors upstream PgQ's split: `pgque_reader` (consume) and `pgque_writer` (produce) are **siblings**, not parent/child. `pgque_admin` is a member of both. Apps that produce **and** consume must be granted both roles explicitly.

| Role | Purpose | Granted access |
|---|---|---|
| `pgque_reader` | Consumers, dashboards, metrics, debugging | Read-only info (`get_queue_info`, `get_consumer_info`, `get_batch_info`, `version`, `select` on all tables) **and** the consume API (`subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `receive`, `ack`, `nack`) plus the underlying PgQ primitives (`next_batch*`, `get_batch_events`, `finish_batch`, `event_retry`, `register_consumer*`, `unregister_consumer`). |
| `pgque_writer` | Producers | The produce API (`send`, `send_batch`) and the underlying primitive (`insert_event`). Does **not** inherit `pgque_reader` — a producer-only role cannot ack/finish/inspect consumer batches. |
| `pgque_admin`  | Operators, migrations | Member of both `pgque_reader` and `pgque_writer`, plus full schema/table/sequence access. `uninstall()` is revoked from both `pgque_admin` and PUBLIC (superuser-only — it drops the schema). |

Typical app setup:

```sql
\i sql/pgque.sql
select pgque.start();                     -- optional pg_cron ticker + maint

-- Produce + consume in the same app: grant BOTH roles.
create user app_orders with password '...';          -- replace with a real password
grant pgque_reader to app_orders;
grant pgque_writer to app_orders;

-- Pure producer (e.g. a webhook ingester that only sends).
create user app_webhook with password '...';
grant pgque_writer to app_webhook;

-- Pure consumer / dashboard / metrics.
create user metrics with password '...';              -- replace with a real password
grant pgque_reader to metrics;
```

DDL-class operations (`create_queue`, `drop_queue`, `start`, `stop`, `maint`, `maint_retry_events`, `ticker`, `force_tick`, `set_queue_config`) are not granted to either `pgque_reader` or `pgque_writer`. The schema-wide blanket `revoke execute … from public` strips PUBLIC, and `pgque_admin` is the only role that retains `execute` on these helpers — perform them as an admin / migration role.

**Roles are global, not per-queue.** A `pgque_reader` granted to an app can ack any consumer's batch and read any other consumer's active batch payloads. Do not grant `pgque_reader` to mutually untrusted applications sharing one database unless you add your own schema-level or database-level isolation. See [docs/reference.md — Roles scope](docs/reference.md#roles-are-global-not-per-queue) for details and recommended isolation patterns.

## Project status

PgQue is **early-stage** as a product and API layer. PgQ itself has run at Skype scale for over a decade. What's new here is the packaging, modernization, managed-Postgres compatibility, and the higher-level PgQue API around that core.

The default install stays small; additional APIs live under `sql/experimental/` until they are worth promoting. See [blueprints/PHASES.md](blueprints/PHASES.md).

## Quick start

```sql
-- tx 1: create queue + consumer
select pgque.create_queue('orders');
select pgque.subscribe('orders', 'processor');

-- tx 2: send a message
select pgque.send('orders', '{"order_id": 42, "total": 99.95}'::jsonb);

-- tx 3: advance the queue if you are not using pg_cron
-- force_tick bumps the event-seq threshold; ticker() then inserts the tick.
-- Each select below is its own implicit transaction in psql autocommit —
-- do NOT wrap these in begin/commit (the tick must see the send committed).
select pgque.force_tick('orders');
select pgque.ticker();

-- tx 4: receive — every returned row carries the same batch_id
select * from pgque.receive('orders', 'processor', 100);
--  msg_id | batch_id |  type   |             payload              | retry_count | ...
-- --------+----------+---------+----------------------------------+-------------+----
--       1 |        1 | default | {"total": 99.95, "order_id": 42} |             |
-- (jsonb sorts object keys by length then alphabetically, so the input
--  '{"order_id": 42, "total": 99.95}' comes back with "total" first)

-- tx 5: ack the batch_id from the previous result
select pgque.ack(1);
```

Send, tick, and receive **must** run in separate transactions — that's a hard requirement of PgQ's snapshot-based design, not a recommendation. A `tick` records a snapshot of committed transaction IDs; a `send` in the same xact is still in-progress at that moment and gets excluded from the next batch's visibility window, so the event never surfaces. In normal operation, `pg_cron` or an external scheduler drives `pgque.ticker()`; `force_tick()` is mainly for demos, tests, and manual operation. In application code, capture `batch_id` from any returned row and pass it to `ack`.

The scriptable psql idiom (replaces tx 4 + tx 5 above):

```sql
select batch_id from pgque.receive('orders', 'processor', 100) limit 1 \gset
select pgque.ack(:batch_id);
```

## Client libraries

PgQue is SQL-first, so any Postgres driver works. Example client libraries exist for **Python**, **Go**, and **TypeScript** — unpublished, still evolving, demonstrating integration patterns rather than stable SDKs. **Contributions welcome.**

### Python (`pgque-py`) — psycopg 3

```python
from pgque import PgqueClient, Consumer

client = PgqueClient(conn)
# type= must match the event type the consumer listens on
client.send("orders", {"order_id": 42}, type="order.created")

consumer = Consumer(dsn, queue="orders", name="processor", poll_interval=30)

@consumer.on("order.created")
def handle_order(msg):
    process_order(msg.payload)

consumer.start()
```

### Go (`pgque-go`) — pgx/v5

```go
client, _ := pgque.Connect(ctx, "postgresql://localhost/mydb")

consumer := client.NewConsumer("orders", "processor")
consumer.Handle("order.created", func(ctx context.Context, msg pgque.Message) error {
    return processOrder(msg)
})
consumer.Start(ctx)
```

### TypeScript (`pgque-ts`) — node-postgres

```ts
const client = new PgqueClient('postgresql://localhost/mydb');
await client.connect();

await client.send('orders', { order_id: 42 }, 'order.created');
await client.subscribe('orders', 'processor');

const messages = await client.receive('orders', 'processor', 100);
if (messages.length > 0) await client.ack(messages[0].batch_id);
```

### Any language

```sql
select pgque.send('orders', '{"order_id": 42}'::jsonb);

-- without pg_cron, advance the queue manually (omit if a ticker is running).
-- Run as separate transactions — do not wrap in begin/commit.
select pgque.force_tick('orders');
select pgque.ticker();

-- receive returns rows; every row carries the same batch_id
select * from pgque.receive('orders', 'processor', 100);

-- ack the batch_id from any returned row (capture it in the driver)
select pgque.ack(1);  -- replace with the batch_id from above
```

## Benchmarks

Preliminary laptop numbers: ~86k ev/s batched PL/pgSQL insert, ~2.4M ev/s
primitive batch read rate (`get_batch_events`), zero dead-tuple growth under a
30-minute sustained test with a blocked xmin horizon (a concurrent long-running
transaction holding an assigned XID — the worst case for SKIP LOCKED queues).
The batch read figure reflects raw PgQ primitive throughput, not end-to-end
`receive()`/`ack()` consumer throughput. See
[docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md) for the full table and methodology.

Preliminary cross-system measurements live in [`benchmark/`](benchmark/).
Numbers there are for reference and exploration, not a final verdict —
benchmarking Postgres queues is hard (cf. Brendan Gregg) and the
methodology continues to evolve.

## Architecture

PgQue keeps PgQ's proven core architecture — snapshot-based batch isolation, three-table TRUNCATE rotation on the hot path, separate retry / delayed / dead-letter tables, and independent per-consumer cursors — and adds a modern API layer on top. See [blueprints/SPECx.md](blueprints/SPECx.md) for the full specification and [docs/pgq-concepts.md](docs/pgq-concepts.md) for the batch/tick/rotation glossary.
