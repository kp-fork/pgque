# PgQue — in-development version

This directory holds the **in-development** PgQue install, ahead of the last
released version. It is for testing upcoming features before they ship; expect
churn and validate against a throwaway database, not production.

The released, stable install lives in [`../../sql/`](../../sql/) — use that for
anything real.

Testing partition keys (ordered per-key processing via slot consumers)? Until
`docs/` coverage lands, follow
[`blueprints/partition-keys/SPEC.md`](../../blueprints/partition-keys/SPEC.md).

Layout:

- `pgque.sql`, `pgque-tle.sql` — generated single-file installs (built from the
  sources below by `build/transform.sh`; do not edit by hand).
- `pgque_uninstall.sql`, `pgque-tle-uninstall.sql` — uninstall scripts.
- `pgque-additions/`, `pgque-api/`, `experimental/` — the SQL sources the build
  reads. Edit these, then re-run `bash build/transform.sh` from the repo root.

## Install

**Requirements:** Postgres 14+, and something that calls `pgque.ticker()`
periodically (see Ticker below).

Run psql from the repo root so the relative path resolves:

```sql
begin;
\i devel/sql/pgque.sql
commit;
```

Or from the shell, in a single transaction:

```bash
PAGER=cat psql --no-psqlrc --single-transaction -d mydb -f devel/sql/pgque.sql
```

To uninstall: `\i devel/sql/pgque_uninstall.sql`.

## Ticker

PgQue does not deliver messages without a ticker: enqueueing works, but
consumers see nothing until ticks are created.

On a quiet queue, the ticker falls back to `queue_ticker_idle_period`
(default 60s), so a newly enqueued event can take up to that long to become
receivable. Run the ticker at your desired cadence to bound this latency.

With `pg_cron` in the same database, one call sets up the ticker and
maintenance jobs (10 ticks/sec by default):

```sql
select pgque.start();
```

Without `pg_cron`, drive it from your application or an external scheduler:

```bash
PAGER=cat psql --no-psqlrc -d mydb -c "select pgque.ticker()"              # at your tick period
PAGER=cat psql --no-psqlrc -d mydb -c "select pgque.maint_retry_events()"  # every 30 seconds
PAGER=cat psql --no-psqlrc -d mydb -c "select pgque.maint()"               # every 30 seconds
```

Skipping `maint_retry_events()` means nack'd events are never redelivered.

## Roles and grants

The install creates three roles. `pgque_reader` (consume) and `pgque_writer`
(produce) are siblings, not parent/child; `pgque_admin` is a member of both.
An app that **both** produces and consumes must be granted **both** roles.

```sql
-- Produce + consume in the same app: grant BOTH roles.
create user app_orders with password '...';
grant pgque_reader to app_orders;
grant pgque_writer to app_orders;

-- Pure producer.
create user app_webhook with password '...';
grant pgque_writer to app_webhook;

-- Pure consumer / dashboard / metrics.
create user metrics with password '...';
grant pgque_reader to metrics;
```

## pg_tle install

To register PgQue as a `pg_tle` extension instead (requires `pg_tle` in
`shared_preload_libraries` and a role with `pgtle_admin` + `CREATEROLE`):

```sql
\i devel/sql/pgque-tle.sql
create extension pgque;
```

To uninstall: `\i devel/sql/pgque-tle-uninstall.sql`.
