 * Worker-1 receives a batch and holds the FOR UPDATE on the coop_main row
 * for 3 seconds. dblink_send_query runs in autocommit, so the entire CTE
 * is one transaction; the lock acquired by receive_coop is held until
 * pg_sleep returns. Worker-2's measured wait (asserted below) proves
 * contention so this assumption cannot silently break.
 *
 * Hold and head-start are sized for slow CI runners: w1 holds 3 s, w2
 * gets a 1 s head start before racing, expected wait ~2 s, asserted at
 * > 1.5 s. The original 0.5 s head-start + 2 s hold proved fragile under
 * load (w1's dblink open + receive_coop traversal can exceed 0.5 s on a
 * loaded PG matrix runner, which would let w2 grab the lock first and
 * make the assertion fail spuriously).
