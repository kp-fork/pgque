# pgque

Ruby client for [PgQue](https://github.com/NikolayS/pgque) — the PgQ-based
universal PostgreSQL queue. Thin wrapper over `pgque-api` SQL functions:
`send`, `receive`, `ack`, `nack`, `force_next_tick`, plus a polling
`Consumer` with `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` wakeup.

## Install

```bash
gem install pgque --pre
```

`--pre` is required while v0.2.0 is in release-candidate; the latest
published version is `0.2.0.rc.1`. Pin the exact version if you prefer:

```ruby
gem "pgque", "0.2.0.rc.1"
```

Requires Ruby 3.1+ and PostgreSQL 14+ with the PgQue schema installed
(`\i pgque.sql` — no extension required).

## Database permissions

The connecting database role needs `pgque_reader` to consume (`receive`,
`ack`, `nack`) and `pgque_writer` to produce (`send`, `send_batch`). The
two are **siblings** — neither inherits the other. An app that both
produces and consumes must be granted **both** roles:

```sql
grant pgque_reader to your_app_user;
grant pgque_writer to your_app_user;
```

See [`docs/reference.md` — Roles and grants](../../docs/reference.md#roles-and-grants).

## Tests

Integration tests require a running PostgreSQL with the PgQue schema
installed. Set `PGQUE_TEST_DSN` and run rake:

```bash
PGQUE_TEST_DSN=postgresql://postgres:pgque_test@localhost/pgque_test \
    bundle exec rake test
```

Without `PGQUE_TEST_DSN`, the tests skip.
