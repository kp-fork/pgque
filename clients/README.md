# PgQue clients

PgQue ships four first-party clients. They are thin wrappers over `pgque.*`
SQL primitives. The matrix below tracks the public client API on current
`main`.

## Release quality rules

These rules are part of the client release process. Do not cut a final client
release until they are satisfied or explicitly documented as intentionally
out-of-scope for that release.

### API parity is required

First-party clients must expose the same public PgQue capabilities in idiomatic
language shape. If Python exposes a normal consumer primitive, Go and
TypeScript should expose it too; if TypeScript has a ticker helper, Python and
Go should have equivalent helpers. Drift is acceptable only when it is a
conscious product decision and recorded here or in the release issue.

Implementation details may differ. For example, Python can use LISTEN/NOTIFY as
a wakeup optimization while Go and TypeScript poll, but the public behavior and
failure semantics must remain equivalent.

Before a final release:

- update the parity matrix below;
- remove every accidental `✗` or convert it into a documented, intentional
  exception;
- verify each new or changed public method has tests in every affected client;
- keep experimental features, especially cooperative consumers, clearly marked
  experimental in all client READMEs.

### Benchmarks must be current before final

Do not quote old client performance numbers in release notes or docs. Before a
final release, rerun the producer benchmarks against current SQL and client
code, especially after changes to `send_batch`, payload encoding, transaction
handling, or driver setup.

Benchmark entry points:

- Python: `clients/python/bench_producer.py`
- Go: `clients/go/producer_benchmark_test.go`
- TypeScript: `clients/typescript/src/producer_bench.ts`

Current published client producer results live in
`benchmark/charts/client_producer_batch_api.csv` and
`benchmark/charts/client_producer_batch_api.svg`. If benchmark results are
published, update both files and state the environment used for the run. Stale
charts are worse than no charts; they give users false confidence, which is how
benchmarks become marketing-shaped lies.

### Testing gates

For any client release candidate or final release:

- run the repo CI client jobs for all first-party clients;
- run package build / pack smoke tests for each ecosystem;
- verify install from the real package index for published RCs before final;
- run at least one clean smoke install for final packages:
  - `pip install pgque-py`
  - `npm install pgque`
  - `go get github.com/NikolayS/pgque-go@vX.Y.Z`
- verify pkg.go.dev renders Go docs and recognizes the license;
- verify npm dist-tags: prereleases use `rc`/`next`, final uses `latest`;
- verify PyPI/TestPyPI and npm/GitHub release automation before relying on it.

### Release documentation

Release prep PRs must update user-facing install commands and remove stale
prerelease wording. When publishing a final release, docs must stop telling
users to install `--pre`, `@rc`, or an `-rc` Go tag.

Legend: ✓ supported by the client API on `main`; ✗ not exposed as a
first-class client API. Lower-level SQL primitives remain available through raw
connection/pool escape hatches. Python, Go, and TypeScript expose `subscribe` /
`unsubscribe` convenience wrappers; Ruby can call those via raw SQL.

[^coop]: Experimental. Each supporting client exposes
    `subscribe_subconsumer` / `unsubscribe_subconsumer` / `receive_coop` /
    `touch_subconsumer` (idiomatic case per language) and a `subconsumer` /
    `dead_interval` option on the high-level consumer. Function names and
    edge-case behavior may change before the feature is marked stable. See
    each client's README for details.
