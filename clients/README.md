# PgQue clients

PgQue ships three first-party clients. They are thin wrappers over `pgque.*`
SQL primitives. The matrix below tracks the public client API on current
`main`.

| Capability | Python | Go | TypeScript |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `connect` / `close` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Raw SQL escape hatch | ✓ (`conn`) | ✓ (`Pool()`) | ✓ (`rawPool`) |
| PgQue-classified errors | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Lossless PostgreSQL `bigint` IDs | ✓ (`int`) | ✓ (`int64`) | ✓ (`bigint`) |
| `send` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `send_batch` / `SendBatch` / `sendBatch` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

Legend: ✓ supported by the client API on `main`; ✗ not exposed as a
first-class client API. Lower-level SQL primitives remain available through raw
connection/pool escape hatches. TypeScript currently exposes extra convenience
wrappers for `ticker` / `forceTick`; Python and Go can call them via raw SQL.
