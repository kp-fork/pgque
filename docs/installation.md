title: Installation and operations
description: Install PgQue on managed or self-hosted Postgres, keep it ticking, grant the right roles, upgrade in place, and troubleshoot the common failures.
---

PgQue is a pure-SQL Postgres queue. There is no extension to compile and no
`shared_preload_libraries` change to make — you install it by running one SQL
file, and you keep it running by calling `pgque.ticker()` on a schedule. This
page covers the full operational loop: install, tick, grant, upgrade, uninstall,
and troubleshoot.

If you are brand new to PgQue, start with the [tutorial](tutorial.md) for a
hands-on walkthrough, then come back here to set up a durable install.

## Requirements

- Postgres 14 or newer. PgQue uses `xid8`, `pg_snapshot`, and
  `pg_current_xact_id()`, which arrived in Postgres 14.
- Something that calls `pgque.ticker()` periodically. Without a ticker,
  producers can enqueue events but consumers see nothing — see
  [ticking](#ticking) below. This is the single most common cause of "it isn't
  working" reports.
- Optionally `pg_cron` or `pg_timetable` to drive the ticker for you. PgQue
  itself works without either; they are only used to schedule the maintenance
  calls.

PgQue runs on managed Postgres (it needs no superuser, no extension, and no
restart) as well as self-hosted clusters.

## Install

Clone the repository and run the single-file installer inside a transaction.
From `psql`:

```sql
begin;
\i sql/pgque.sql
commit;
```

Or as a shell one-liner from the repository root:

```bash
PAGER=cat psql --no-psqlrc --single-transaction -d mydb -f sql/pgque.sql
```

The installer creates the `pgque` schema, all functions and tables, and the
three roles (`pgque_reader`, `pgque_writer`, `pgque_admin`). It is idempotent —
re-running it upgrades an existing install in place (see [upgrading](#upgrading)).

Verify the install:

```sql
select pgque.version();
```

At this point the queue machinery exists but nothing is ticking yet. Set up a
ticker next.

## Ticking

A tick is the unit that makes enqueued events visible to consumers. Until a tick
covers an event, `receive()` will not return it. You therefore need
`pgque.ticker()` to run on a schedule. PgQue ticks 10 times per second by
default (one tick every 100 ms). There are three ways to drive it.

### Option A — pg_cron (recommended)

If `pg_cron` is available, one call schedules everything:

```sql
select pgque.start();
```

`pgque.start()` registers four `pg_cron` jobs:

| Job | Cadence | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pgque_ticker` | every 1 s | runs `pgque.ticker_loop()`, which re-ticks sub-second inside each 1 s slot at the configured rate (default 10 ticks/sec) |
| `pgque_retry_events` | every 30 s | moves `nack`'d events from the retry queue back into the stream |
| `pgque_maint` | every 30 s | table-rotation step 1 (and any queue extra-maint hooks) |
| `pgque_rotate_step2` | every 10 s | table-rotation step 2, which must run in its own transaction |

`pg_cron`'s minimum granularity is one second, so the ticker job fires once per
second and `pgque.ticker_loop()` does the sub-second re-ticking within that slot.
`pgque.start()` requires `pg_cron` and raises a clear error if it is absent; PgQue
itself does not. Stop the jobs with `pgque.stop()`.

`pg_cron` runs jobs in a single designated database (`cron.database_name`,
typically `postgres`). If your PgQue schema lives in a different database,
`pgque.start()` will not reach it from the cron database — instead schedule the
jobs with `cron.schedule_in_database`, pointing each at PgQue's database:

```sql
select cron.schedule_in_database('pgque_ticker', '1 second',
  $$call pgque.ticker_loop()$$, 'mydb');
select cron.schedule_in_database('pgque_retry_events', '30 seconds',
  $$select pgque.maint_retry_events()$$, 'mydb');
select cron.schedule_in_database('pgque_maint', '30 seconds',
  $$select pgque.maint()$$, 'mydb');
```

### Option B — pg_timetable

If you run `pg_timetable`, use its variant. It schedules the same four jobs:

```sql
select pgque.start_timetable();   -- ticks_per_second defaults to 10
select pgque.start_timetable(10); -- explicit form
```

`pg_timetable` is an external, long-running scheduler process (not a Postgres
background worker), so keep its worker running against PgQue's database with
`--clientname=pgque`. Stop with `pgque.stop_timetable()`. The two schedulers are
mutually exclusive: `pgque.start_timetable()` first removes any PgQue `pg_cron`
jobs, and `pgque.start()` first removes any PgQue `pg_timetable` jobs, so
switching between them never leaves both ticking.

### Option C — manual or external scheduler

With no in-database scheduler, call the maintenance functions yourself from any
external scheduler (a sidecar loop, a cron'd `psql`, an application worker):

```sql
select pgque.ticker();              -- create ticks for eligible queues
select pgque.maint_retry_events();  -- re-queue due retry events
select pgque.maint();               -- rotation step 1 (and any queue extra-maint hooks)
```

For sub-second delivery, loop `pgque.ticker()` at your desired interval rather
than relying on a once-per-second slot. Each `pgque.ticker()` call must commit
before the next, so an external loop should commit between iterations.

> Without a working ticker, enqueue succeeds but consumers see nothing. If
> `receive()` returns no rows, check that a ticker is running first.

## Enabling pg_cron on managed platforms

`pgque.start()` needs `pg_cron` in the database, and PgQue's 1-second ticker
relies on the sub-minute (`'1 second'`) schedule syntax that arrived in
`pg_cron` 1.5. Most managed platforms ship `pg_cron` 1.6.x, which is fine. If a
platform only offers `pg_cron` older than 1.5, skip `pgque.start()` and drive
the ticker from an external scheduler instead — see
[Option C](#option-c--manual-or-external-scheduler).

`pg_cron` runs jobs in one database (`cron.database_name`, default `postgres`).
If your PgQue schema lives elsewhere, point `cron.database_name` at it or use
`cron.schedule_in_database` as shown under [ticking](#option-a--pg_cron-recommended).

After enabling `pg_cron` on any platform below, install it in the target
database and start the ticker:

```sql
create extension if not exists pg_cron;
select pgque.start();
```

### Managed clouds

**Amazon RDS / Amazon Aurora.** Add `pg_cron` to `shared_preload_libraries` in
a custom DB (cluster) parameter group, then reboot the instance. Connect as an
`rds_superuser` and `create extension pg_cron;`. To run the ticker in your PgQue
database rather than `postgres`, set the `cron.database_name` parameter to it.
See the official setup guides for
[RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/PostgreSQL_pg_cron.html)
and
[Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/PostgreSQL_pg_cron.html).

**Azure Database for PostgreSQL — Flexible Server.** Add `pg_cron` to the
`azure.extensions` server parameter and to `shared_preload_libraries`, then
restart the server. `create extension pg_cron;` in the target database. Azure
does not use `cron.database_name`; use `cron.schedule_in_database(...)` to run
jobs in a specific database, and omit the job username (jobs run as the
scheduling user, which needs `azure_pg_admin`). See the official
[pg_cron considerations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/extensions/concepts-extensions-considerations#pg_cron).

**Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL.** Set the database flag
`cloudsql.enable_pg_cron=on` (this restarts the instance), then
`create extension pg_cron;`. Set the `cron.database_name` flag if you want cron
in a non-default database. See the official
[Cloud SQL extensions reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/extensions).

**Google AlloyDB for PostgreSQL.** Set the instance flag
`alloydb.enable_pg_cron=on` (requires an instance restart), then
`create extension pg_cron;` in each target database. The `cron.database_name`
flag is settable once enabled. See the official
[AlloyDB flags](https://docs.cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/reference/alloydb-flags)
and
[supported extensions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/reference/extensions)
references.

**Supabase.** Enable the `pg_cron` extension from the Dashboard
(Integrations → Cron), or run `create extension if not exists pg_cron;`. No
restart needed. On the standard project database no `cron.database_name` change
is required. See the official
[pg_cron extension](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_cron)
and [Cron](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cron) docs.

**Neon.** Set `cron.database_name` to the target database via the compute
endpoint settings, restart the compute, then
`create extension if not exists pg_cron;`. Note the auto-ticker only fires while
the compute is active — disable scale-to-zero (or run the compute 24/7) so ticks
keep flowing during idle periods. See the official
[pg_cron extension](https://neon.com/docs/extensions/pg_cron) docs.

**Aiven for PostgreSQL.** `pg_cron` is already preloaded; just
`create extension pg_cron;` in the target database as `avnadmin` (or another
admin user). See the official
[pg_cron how-to](https://aiven.io/docs/products/postgresql/howto/use-pg-cron-extension).

**DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL.** `create extension pg_cron;` — no special
preload step. `cron.database_name` is not configurable on this platform, so
`pg_cron` (and therefore the auto-ticker) only operates in the `defaultdb`
database; install PgQue there if you want the in-database ticker. See the
official
[supported extensions](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/postgresql/details/supported-extensions/)
docs.

**Crunchy Bridge.** `pg_cron` is preloadable on Bridge; just
`create extension pg_cron;` in the target database. Set `cron.database_name` if
you want cron in a non-default database. See the official
[extensions and languages](https://docs.crunchybridge.com/extensions-and-languages)
docs.

**Tiger Data (Tiger Cloud).** Connect as the `tsdbadmin` user and run
`create extension if not exists pg_cron;`. See the official
[extensions](https://www.tigerdata.com/docs/deploy/mst/extensions) docs.

**ClickHouse Cloud (Managed Postgres).** Connect and run
`create extension pg_cron;` — `pg_cron` 1.6 is available, no preload step. See
the official
[Managed Postgres extensions](https://clickhouse.com/docs/cloud/managed-postgres/extensions)
docs.

**IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL.** `create extension pg_cron;`, then
schedule jobs with `cron.schedule()` against the target database. See the
official
[pg_cron](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-pg_cron)
docs.

**Oracle OCI Database with PostgreSQL.** Enable `pg_cron` in a custom database
configuration (via the OCI Extension Manager in the Console), apply it to the
database system, then `create extension pg_cron;`. `pg_cron` runs in the
`postgres` database by default; set `pg_cron.database_name` to target another.
See the official
[extensions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/postgresql/extensions.htm)
and
[pg_cron release notes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/releasenotes/postgresql/pg_cron-pgaudit.htm)
docs.

**Ubicloud Managed PostgreSQL.** `create extension pg_cron;` — `pg_cron` 1.6
ships in the managed image, no preload step. See the official
[extensions](https://www.ubicloud.com/docs/managed-postgresql/extensions) docs.

### Postgres-compatible platforms

**PlanetScale for Postgres.** Enable `pg_cron` from the dashboard
(Clusters → branch → Extensions), queue and apply the change (this restarts the
database), then `create extension if not exists pg_cron;`. Set
`cron.database_name` to the database where you created the extension. See the
official
[pg_cron extension](https://planetscale.com/docs/postgres/extensions/pg_cron)
docs.

**YugabyteDB.** Set the cluster-wide gflag `enable_pg_cron=true` on all
YB-Masters and YB-TServers, optionally set `ysql_cron_database_name` (defaults
to `yugabyte`), then `create extension pg_cron;` as a superuser. Jobs run on a
single elected `pg_cron` leader; expect a worst-case ~60 s gap on leader
failover or job changes — acceptable for the rotation ticker. See the official
[pg_cron extension](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/additional-features/pg-extensions/extension-pgcron/)
docs.

### Kubernetes operators

**Zalando postgres-operator.** `pg_cron` ships in the Spilo image but is not
preloaded by default. Add it to `shared_preload_libraries` in the cluster
manifest, then `create extension pg_cron;`:

```yaml
spec:
  postgresql:
    parameters:
      shared_preload_libraries: "bg_mon,pg_stat_statements,pg_cron"
```

Applying the manifest triggers the restart the `shared_preload_libraries` change
needs; default DB is `postgres`, or set `cron.database_name`. The Spilo image
[bundles `pg_cron`](https://github.com/zalando/spilo/blob/master/postgres-appliance/build_scripts/base.sh).

**StackGres.** Declare `pg_cron` in the `SGCluster` extensions list (StackGres
downloads it into the container — no custom image), add
`shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_cron'` to the referenced `SGPostgresConfig`,
trigger a restart via an `SGDbOps` operation, then `create extension pg_cron;`.
See the official
[extensions](https://stackgres.io/doc/1.5/administration/extensions/) docs.

**CloudNativePG.** `pg_cron` is not in the stock CNPG image — build a custom
operand image with the PGDG `postgresql-NN-cron` package. Declare it in
`.spec.postgresql.shared_preload_libraries: ["pg_cron"]`, create the extension
via `.spec.bootstrap.initdb.postInitSQL` (or manually), and let the operator do
the rolling restart that the `shared_preload_libraries` change requires. See the
official
[PostgreSQL configuration](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/postgresql_conf/)
docs and the
[postgres-extensions-containers](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/postgres-extensions-containers)
repo.

**Percona Operator for PostgreSQL.** Add `pg_cron` as a custom extension package
under `.spec.extensions.custom` and list it in the Patroni
`shared_preload_libraries`. Applying the CR restarts the cluster Pods; then
connect to the primary and `create extension pg_cron;` in each target database.
You may need to host the extension package yourself for your Postgres major.
See the official
[custom extensions](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/2.8.1/custom-extensions.html)
docs.

## Tick rate

The default tick period is 100 ms (10 ticks per second). Tune it with:

```sql
select pgque.set_tick_period_ms(50); -- 20 ticks/sec
```

Accepted values are exact divisors of 1000 in the range 1..1000 ms (for example
1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000). A value that does not divide 1000
evenly is rejected. The new period is picked up on the next ticker slot.

A faster tick means lower delivery latency at the cost of more tick rows and
maintenance work; a slower tick is cheaper but raises latency. For the latency
and cost trade-offs, see [latency-and-tuning.md](latency-and-tuning.md).

## Roles and grants

PgQue ships three roles. `pgque_reader` and `pgque_writer` are **siblings**, not
parent and child — neither inherits the other.

| Role | For | Capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pgque_reader` | consumers, dashboards | consume API (`subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `receive`, `ack`, `nack`), read-only info functions, `select` on tables. Cannot produce. |
| `pgque_writer` | producers | produce API (`send`, `send_batch`, `insert_event`). Cannot consume. |
| `pgque_admin` | operators, migrations | member of both reader and writer, plus lifecycle and DDL (`create_queue`, `drop_queue`, `start`, `stop`, `maint`, `set_queue_config`). `uninstall()` is owner/superuser-only — revoked from `pgque_admin`. |

Because the roles are siblings, an application that both produces and consumes
must be granted **both**:

```sql
grant pgque_writer to app_orders;
grant pgque_reader to app_orders;
```

A producer-only service needs only the writer role:

```sql
grant pgque_writer to app_webhook;
```

A consumer-only or monitoring service needs only the reader role:

```sql
grant pgque_reader to metrics;
```

PUBLIC can read the metadata catalog tables but cannot execute any PgQue
function. Lifecycle and DDL functions are admin-only — run them as a migration or
operator role that holds `pgque_admin`. Roles are cluster-global and not scoped
per queue; see [reference.md](reference.md) for the role-scope details.

## Upgrading

To upgrade, re-run [`sql/pgque.sql`](https://github.com/NikolayS/pgque/blob/main/sql/pgque.sql) over the existing install,
in a single transaction, as the schema owner or a superuser. From the repository
root:

```bash
PAGER=cat psql --no-psqlrc --single-transaction -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d mydb -f sql/pgque.sql
```

The installer is idempotent. It preserves queues, consumers, subscriptions, retry
rows, dead-letter rows, and existing event tables while adding any new functions,
columns, grants, and constraints the target release needs.

One grant subtlety: `create or replace function` preserves existing grants, and
Postgres does not auto-revoke role-to-role grants. The installer therefore
explicitly revokes the older `pgque_reader -> pgque_writer` grant and re-applies
function grants on the corrected sibling roles. After upgrading, confirm the
version:

```sql
select pgque.version();
```

## Uninstall

To remove PgQue, run the uninstall script. It stops the scheduler on a
best-effort basis and drops the `pgque` schema with `cascade`:

```sql
\i sql/pgque_uninstall.sql
```

The schema and all its data are dropped. The three roles are **not** dropped,
because Postgres roles are cluster-global and may be referenced elsewhere; drop
them yourself if you no longer need them.

## pg_tle packaging variant

[`sql/pgque-tle.sql`](https://github.com/NikolayS/pgque/blob/main/sql/pgque-tle.sql) installs the same function and table surface wrapped as a
[pg_tle](https://github.com/aws/pg_tle) trusted-language extension, so PgQue
appears in `pg_available_extensions` and is managed with `create extension` /
`drop extension`. It trades the zero-dependency `\i` install for a `pg_tle`
prerequisite.

Prerequisites: `pg_tle` must be in `shared_preload_libraries`, and the installer
must run as a role holding `pgtle_admin` plus `CREATEROLE` (the roles are created
outside the extension body since they are cluster-global).

First make sure `pg_tle` is preloaded. **Append** it to the existing list —
overwriting `shared_preload_libraries` would disable anything else you preload
(for example `pg_cron`):

```sql
show shared_preload_libraries;                                -- inspect the current list first
alter system set shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_cron,pg_tle'; -- keep existing entries
-- restart Postgres, then in the target database:
create extension pg_tle;
```

With `pg_tle` loaded, register and create PgQue:

```sql
\i sql/pgque-tle.sql
create extension pgque;
```

Uninstall the TLE variant with:

```sql
\i sql/pgque-tle-uninstall.sql
```

If you have no specific reason to use `pg_tle`, prefer the plain [`sql/pgque.sql`](https://github.com/NikolayS/pgque/blob/main/sql/pgque.sql)
install above.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `receive()` returns no events | No ticker is running, so no ticks exist | Start a ticker: `pgque.start()`, `pgque.start_timetable()`, or a manual `pgque.ticker()` loop (see [ticking](#ticking)) |
| The same batch comes back every time | The batch was never acknowledged | Call `pgque.ack(batch_id)` after processing; an unacked batch is redelivered |
| Retried events never reappear | `maint_retry_events()` is not running | Ensure the retry job runs (`pgque.start()` schedules it every 30 s; otherwise call `pgque.maint_retry_events()` yourself) |
| Queue / event tables grow without bound | A stopped or stuck consumer pins the oldest tick and blocks table rotation | Resume or unsubscribe the wedged consumer; rotation can then truncate old tables. See [concepts.md](concepts.md) on rotation |
| `force_tick` / `force_next_tick` looks like a no-op | These only bump the event sequence; they do not insert a tick | Run the ticker afterward: `select pgque.force_next_tick('q'); select pgque.ticker('q');` |
| Permission denied calling `send` (or `ack`/`receive`) | The role lacks the matching sibling role | Grant `pgque_writer` to produce, `pgque_reader` to consume, both to do both (see [roles and grants](#roles-and-grants)) |

For consumer-side health metrics (lag, pending events, batch state) see
[monitoring.md](monitoring.md). For end-to-end examples (fan-out, exactly-once)
see [examples.md](examples.md).
