Documentation for PgQue, the zero-bloat Postgres queue: a hands-on tutorial, operations guides, a function reference, and the concepts behind the design, plus a contributor primer.

## Get started

- **[Tutorial](tutorial.md)** — a hands-on walkthrough. Send, tick, receive,
  retry, DLQ, observability. Start here if you are new.

## Guides

- **[Installation and operations](installation.md)** — install, ticking,
  role grants, uninstall, and troubleshooting.
- **[Examples](examples.md)** — short patterns: fan-out, exactly-once,
  batch send, recurring jobs, DLQ inspection, and
  [cooperative consumers / subconsumers](examples.md#cooperative-consumers--subconsumers-experimental)
  (experimental).
- **[Monitoring and health](monitoring.md)** — queue, consumer, and batch
  introspection; lag and pending-event signals; what to alert on.

## Reference

- **[Function reference](reference.md)** — every function, return type, and
  role grant in the default install.

## Explanation

- **[Latency and tick tuning](latency-and-tuning.md)** — how ticks shape
  end-to-end delivery latency, choosing `tick_period_ms`, and idle backoff.
- **[Concepts and heritage](concepts.md)** — the core vocabulary (event,
  batch, tick, rotation, ticker rule) and where PgQue comes from.

For the full specification and implementation plan, see

For what ships in the default install versus what is experimental, see
